# autoSteg
A shell script that automates steganography

Simply have this script, a text file and an image in a directory, then compile and run this script and it will guide you through the whole process, feel free to contact me if anything goes wrong or unexpected

NOTE: once you are in your directory with your image, text file, and script, type source autosteg.sh then type AS (This will compile and run the script for you)
